#Machine Learning Mondays
###A place to learn about and collaborate on data science and machine learning topics

####Overview

Machine learning is not a new phenomenon. Computer scientists have tried to give computers intelligence (artificial intelligence) to solve problems on their own for decades. During this time, the field has gone through several cycles of excitement and disallusionment. But something different is happening this time around (they think...).

While general articificial intelligence (think human brain) may still be a long way off, the machine learning is having a significant impact on products..

####Schedule

We'll coordinate this week to determine a time or set of times over the next several weeks to plan gatherings and share findings. Share your ideas!
